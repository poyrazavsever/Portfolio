            When I first got my computer, I decided to play GTA 5 with a friend. We bought GTA5 and played for a while. But it was very difficult to make money in the game, to buy something. As such, we slowly started to cool off from the game. It's been a long time and I saw the game in my library. And I started to think about how to start the game again. After thinking about it for a while, it occurred to me to cheat. I searched youtube for the GTA5 cheat. And I followed the instructions in the first video. Although I don't believe it, the trick worked! I was surprised by this. I started researching how these tricks came about and how they were done. That's how I met software.
