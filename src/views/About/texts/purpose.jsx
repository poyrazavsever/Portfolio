            My primary goal is to get somewhere in my software life and to be a qualified employee. After seeing how things work in teamwork, I want to establish my own company and offer useful work to people. Although all my current studies are in this direction, I am aware that I need to work more disciplined. I hope to be a qualified software developer in the position I want in the future.
