      I'm Poyraz Avsever. I have been interested in software and design since I was a child and trying to improve myself. I decided to turn my interest and curiosity about software into my future profession. Although I have been interested in this field for a long time, I have been developing projects and learning something for the last 1 year. Along with software, I am also interested in football, music and mathematics.
